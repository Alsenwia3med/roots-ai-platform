 * Every value below is one cell of that workbook, read as text and trimmed of
 * wrapping whitespace. Nothing is re-typed, re-cased, re-ordered or rounded:
 * sheet order is preserved, row order is preserved, and a cell that is empty
 * in the source is the empty string here. The content hash covers exactly
 * those cells, so an edited source changes this file and an edited file no
 * longer matches the source. No timestamp is embedded, which keeps an
 * unchanged source byte-reproducible across regenerations.
 *
 * Golden-test JSON is kept as the source's own string.

/**
 * The C-02 workbook is the authority on HOW answers become numbers: domains,
 * the 40 mapped questions, option points, formulas SC-001..SC-008, protective
 * factors, classification bands, driver rules and 30 golden tests.
 *
 * The engine in lib/assessment/ must implement these rules and nothing else;
 * scoring-rules.ts cites these rows by id and refuses to start if a rule it
 * implements is absent or worded differently. Golden-test payloads stay as the
 * source's own JSON text so that a test can never be quietly rewritten.
