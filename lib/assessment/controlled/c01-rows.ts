 * Every value below is one cell of that workbook, read as text and trimmed of
 * wrapping whitespace. Nothing is re-typed, re-cased, re-ordered or rounded:
 * sheet order is preserved, row order is preserved, and a cell that is empty
 * in the source is the empty string here. The content hash covers exactly
 * those cells, so an edited source changes this file and an edited file no
 * longer matches the source. No timestamp is embedded, which keeps an
 * unchanged source byte-reproducible across regenerations.
 *
 * Numbers stay strings because the sheet stores them as text.
